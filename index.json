[{"content":" This post is very obviously a draft, and more just a collection of thoughts.\nAfter a long time of research I finally came around to building my own website. Well, two actually. This is a bit of commentary on how I went about building it and what I want to do with this site in the future.\nMy site is built on two different technologies. The frontpage of my site, nezzy.xyz is built using carrd.co. The blog itself was built using the static site generator hugo and hosted through github pages.\nBuilding the site through carrd was incredibly easy. It\u0026rsquo;s no-code building site is perfect for building any kind of site and it seemed a perfect fit for the first jump into web development.\nThe simplicity of carrd is also its main limitation. It\u0026rsquo;s limited in scope past its use as a frontpage or informational center, which is why I created a blog using hugo.\nThe experience with hugo is great, albiet way more involved compared to using carrd. As I learn more about it, the more I enjoy using it.\nFor the next year I\u0026rsquo;ll be using both carrd and this hugo site in tandem to feel each platform out (since I already paid for carrd pro for a year). After a year I\u0026rsquo;ll definitely consider consolidating my platform down into one site, most likely through this site.\n","permalink":"https://nezzy.xyz/posts/firstwebsite/","summary":"This post is very obviously a draft, and more just a collection of thoughts.\nAfter a long time of research I finally came around to building my own website.
